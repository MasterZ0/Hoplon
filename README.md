This game was a test proposed for a job interview

##  About the test

The objective was to reproduce the mechanics of Space Invaders, adding a missile mechanic and another of my choice. I chose to add some random items to test design patterns that I learned recently. Altogether I used Singleton, State, Observer, Object Pool, Factory, Builder and Strategy.

The 3d models, animations and effects I made using Unity resources. The UI sprites I made in photoshop. The game icon and sounds I got from the internet, just making small changes through FMOD.

## Commands
- Move: Left and Right Arrows
- Shoot: Space
- Missile: Left Ctrl
